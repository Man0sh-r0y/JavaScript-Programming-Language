# Javascript is single threaded but asynchronous, So how both works together?

JavaScript's ability to be both single-threaded and asynchronous can seem contradictory at first, but it's actually a clever design that allows for efficient handling of tasks without blocking the main execution thread. Here's how it works:

1. **Single-threaded Nature:**

* JavaScript has a single call stack, meaning it executes one piece of code at a time, in order.
* If a piece of code takes a long time to run (e.g., a network request), the entire thread is blocked, and the browser becomes unresponsive.

2. **Asynchronous Operations:**

* To avoid blocking the thread, JavaScript uses an event loop and a callback queue.
* Asynchronous operations (like fetching data from an API or setting a timeout) are offloaded to the browser's Web APIs.
* Once these operations are complete, they push a callback function into the callback queue.

3. **Event Loop:**

* The event loop constantly checks if the call stack is empty.
* If the call stack is empty, it takes the first callback function from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack to be executed.

Example:

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout");
}, 1000);

console.log("End");
```

* This code will print "Start", then "End", and finally "Timeout" after one second.
* Even though `setTimeout` is supposed to wait 1 second, it doesn't block the execution of the rest of the code.

#### Key Points:

* **Synchronous vs Asynchronous** : Synchronous functions wait for tasks to complete, causing delays. Asynchronous functions allow other tasks to run simultaneously.
* **Callbacks and Promises** : Early asynchronous functions used callbacks, which can be complex. Modern JavaScript uses Promises for better readability and error handling.
* **Event Handlers** : Asynchronous programming often involves event handlers, which respond to events like HTTP request completions.
